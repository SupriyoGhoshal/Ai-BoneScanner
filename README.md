🦴 NutriBone – AI-Based Bone Health Scanner

NutriBone is an AI-powered bone health analysis system designed to assist in early identification of bone-related risks using medical imaging and nutritional data.
The project focuses on applying machine learning techniques to healthcare data with special attention to imbalanced datasets.

🚀 Key Features

AI-based analysis of bone health indicators

Risk prediction for bone weakness and deficiencies

Focus on healthcare-specific evaluation metrics

Simple and scalable backend architecture

🧠 Problem Statement

Bone-related disorders such as osteoporosis often remain undetected until advanced stages.
Manual analysis of medical scans and reports is time-consuming and prone to subjectivity.

NutriBone aims to:

Assist healthcare professionals with AI-driven insights

Enable early risk assessment using data-driven methods

Explore practical applications of machine learning in healthcare

🏗️ System Architecture

Input Layer

Medical imaging data (X-ray / scan images)

Nutritional and basic patient information

Data Processing

Image preprocessing and normalization

Feature extraction and data cleaning

Machine Learning Model

ML models trained for bone risk classification

Handling imbalanced medical datasets

Backend & API

FastAPI for model inference

REST APIs to serve predictions

Frontend (Optional)

React-based dashboard for result visualization

📊 Model Evaluation

Since healthcare datasets are often imbalanced, accuracy alone is not sufficient.

The project emphasizes:

Precision – to reduce false positives

Recall – to reduce false negatives

Confusion matrix for performance analysis

🛠️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, basic image processing

Backend: FastAPI

Frontend: React.js

Tools: Git, GitHub, Jupyter Notebook

⚠️ Limitations

Uses limited dataset size (academic project)

Model performance depends on data quality

Not intended for real-world medical diagnosis

🌱 Future Improvements

Training on larger and diverse datasets

Improved explainability for medical professionals
